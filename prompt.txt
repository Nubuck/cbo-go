I'd like to make a side quest now to produce a request Management insight report on the current state of the CBO verification solution.

Using the Roboteur record store feature, I store case models in a sqlite table called static_storage_record where the case model is stored in the json field entryData. This is the table schema:

CREATE TABLE `static_storage_record` (`_id` char(36), `createdAt` datetime, `updatedAt` datetime, `storageId` varchar(255), `entryData` json, primary key (`_id`))

These are actual case model examples with the sensitive data replaced with xxx

Valid:

Here are some current queries that I use to draw rudimentary MI reports:

totals by product:

SELECT
    json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber') AS dateNumber,
	CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.status') = 'review' THEN 'reassigned' ELSE json_extract(entryData, '$.status') END as status,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.productType') = 'Personal Loan' THEN 1 END) AS PersonalLoanCount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.productType') = 'Credit Card' THEN 1 END) AS CreditCardCount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.productType') = 'Overdraft' THEN 1 END) AS OverdraftCount
FROM
    static_storage_record
WHERE
json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber') > 20241020
GROUP BY
    json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber'),
    json_extract(entryData, '$.status')
ORDER BY
    json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber');

totals by status:

SELECT
    json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber') AS dateNumber,
    COUNT(json_extract(entryData, '$.status')) AS ProcessCount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.status') = 'complete' THEN 1 END) AS CompleteCount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.status') = 'request' THEN 1 END) AS RequestCount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN json_extract(entryData, '$.status') = 'review' THEN 1 END) AS ReassignCount
FROM
    static_storage_record
WHERE
json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber') > 20241020
GROUP BY
    json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber')
ORDER BY
    json_extract(entryData, '$.dateNumber');


I would like to present a better set of reports today. Please help me query and structure the following:

- total tasks processed vs total cases by case _id:
  - how many first time complete status
  - how many times was a case pended by the review and request status

- what are the most common reasons for pending based on the requestPaqComment and requestApplicationComment values, I know for sure the Disbursement account mismatch is the most common, but how to query this?

Please suggest any other insight metrics you think the execs might find interesting and as always ask me anything
