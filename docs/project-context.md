# Hybrid Document Validation System - Project Context

## Implementation Progress 

### Document Processing Pipeline
We've implemented a robust document processing pipeline that:
- Handles both digital PDFs and scanned documents
- Uses pdf.js-extract for digital content
- Combines pdf-to-img and tesseract-wasm for OCR 
- Includes OpenCV-based image preprocessing
- Detects and validates signatures

### Key Components
1. `DocumentProcessor`
   - Unified processing for digital and scanned docs
   - Image preprocessing and enhancement
   - OCR with region-based retries
   - Signature detection
   - Memory management and cleanup
   - Model path configuration and auto-detection

2. `DocumentValidationCLI`
   - Integration with HybridValidator
   - Combined digital/OCR content preparation
   - Enhanced reporting and validation
   - Error handling and fallbacks

### Current Implementation State
- Successfully integrated document processing pipeline
- Added image preprocessing capabilities
- Implemented unified text box model
- Added signature detection
- Working on OCR model loading issues

### Learnings & Improvements
1. OCR Model Management:
   - Need robust model path handling
   - Should support multiple model locations
   - Consider adding model download capability
   - May need version checks

2. Processing Optimizations:
   - Added region-based OCR retries
   - Enhanced image preprocessing for poor quality docs
   - Improved signature detection
   - Memory management for large documents

3. Error Handling:
   - Added fallback to digital-only processing
   - Better error reporting and logging
   - OCR availability checks
   - Clear feedback on processing status

## Next Steps
1. Debug OCR model loading
2. Enhance preprocessing for poor quality scans
3. Implement section-based validation
4. Add support for out-of-order pages
5. Handle mixed digital/scanned content

## Technology Stack
- Node.js 20
- pdf-to-img for page extraction
- pdf.js-extract for digital content
- tesseract-wasm for OCR
- @techstark/opencv-js for image processing
- sharp for image handling
- fast-fuzzy and fuse.js for matching

## Critical Considerations
1. Image Processing
   - Check page brightness and contrast
   - Handle orientation issues
   - Scale for better OCR results
   - Support post-processing retries

2. Content Extraction
   - Handle both digital and scanned content
   - Support mixed document types
   - Deal with poor quality scans
   - Manage processing failures

3. Validation
   - Cross-validate digital and OCR results
   - Handle confidence scoring
   - Support spatial verification
   - Validate signatures and initials

## Dependencies
```json
{
  "pdf-to-img": "^4.2.0",
  "pdf.js-extract": "^0.2.1", 
  "tesseract-wasm": "^0.10.0",
  "@techstark/opencv-js": "^4.10.0-release.1",
  "sharp": "^0.33.5",
  "fast-fuzzy": "^1.12.0",
  "fuse.js": "^7.0.0"
}
```

This new approach provides a more robust foundation for handling document variations while maintaining high validation accuracy. We're continuing to improve the preprocessing and OCR capabilities while keeping the system flexible enough to handle both digital and scanned documents effectively.
