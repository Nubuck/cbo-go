# Hybrid Document Validation System - Project Context

## Current Implementation
We have established a two-phase approach to document validation:

### Phase 1 - Immediate Hybrid Solution
Currently implementing an enhanced validation system that leverages:
- Multiple extraction strategies (digital PDF, OCR, hybrid)
- Pre-trained models without custom training
- Confidence-based result selection
- Cross-validation with case data

Key Components Built:
1. `HybridDocumentProcessor` - Core processing system
2. `DocumentValidationCLI` - Command line interface for testing
3. Enhanced validation strategies for PAQ documents

Current Focus:
- Testing with sample documents
- Refining validation accuracy
- Reducing manual review cases

### Phase 2 - Future Custom Model Development
Planned but not yet implemented:
- Custom model training pipeline
- Document understanding models
- Specialized signature detection
- Full document decision system

## Technology Stack
Current implementation uses:
- Node.js 20
- pdf-to-img
- pdf.js-extract
- tesseract-wasm
- @techstark/opencv-js
- sharp
- fast-fuzzy

## Critical Components

### Validation Strategies
1. Digital PDF Extraction
   - Direct text extraction
   - Pattern matching
   - Structure analysis

2. OCR-based Extraction
   - Image preprocessing
   - Enhanced OCR
   - Field location

3. Hybrid Approach
   - Combined analysis
   - Confidence scoring
   - Result merging

### Validation Profiles
Defined for PAQ documents:
```javascript
{
  criticalFields: {
    quoteRef: {
      pattern: /Quote ref number\s*:\s*(\d{10})/i,
      crossMatch: 'caseReference',
      required: true
    },
    payoutAmount: {
      pattern: /Payout amount\s*:?\s*R?\s*([\d,\.]+)/i,
      valueType: 'currency',
      required: true
    }
    // ... other fields
  },
  crossValidation: {
    references: ['quoteRef', 'caseReference'],
    financials: ['payoutAmount', 'creditAdvanced']
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Test current implementation with sample documents
2. Refine validation strategies
3. Enhance reporting and recommendations
4. Add batch processing capabilities

### Future Integration
1. Pre-trained model integration
2. Enhanced signature detection
3. Custom model training pipeline
4. Full document decision system

## Current Challenges
1. Fragmented text in digital PDFs
2. Custom font rendering issues
3. Signature/initial detection accuracy
4. Cross-validation confidence

## Sample Documents
Currently testing with:
1. Digital PAQ documents
2. Scanned PAQ documents
3. Documents with signatures/initials
4. Problem cases with various issues

## Key Metrics
Tracking:
1. Field extraction accuracy
2. Validation confidence
3. Processing time
4. Manual review rate

## Dependencies
```json
{
  "pdf-to-img": "^4.2.0",
  "pdf.js-extract": "^0.2.1",
  "tesseract-wasm": "^0.10.0",
  "@techstark/opencv-js": "^4.10.0-release.1",
  "sharp": "^0.33.5",
  "fast-fuzzy": "^1.12.0"
}
```

## Continue From Here
To continue development:
1. Run current implementation against sample documents
2. Analyze results and identify improvement areas
3. Implement additional validation strategies
4. Begin planning Phase 2 implementation

The immediate focus should be on:
1. Testing current hybrid validation system
2. Refining validation accuracy
3. Reducing manual review cases
4. Preparing for pre-trained model integration

Next chat should focus on:
1. Results from sample document testing
2. Specific validation improvements needed
3. Additional extraction strategies
4. Pre-trained model integration planning

This context provides the foundation for continuing development in the next chat session.
