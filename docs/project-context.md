   - Multi-stage OCR with adaptive enhancement
   - Image preprocessing and quality analysis
   - Proper resource cleanup
   - Robust error handling

2. `AdaptiveOCRProcessor`
   - Targeted region processing
   - Multiple retry strategies
   - Content-type specific enhancement profiles
   - Smart confidence scoring
   - Format validation

3. `ValueNormalizer`
   - Robust text normalization
   - Type-specific value handling
   - OCR correction support
   - Enhanced confidence scoring
   - Specialized field type handling

### Current Implementation State

The current implementation provides a robust foundation for processing both digital and scanned documents. The adaptive OCR pipeline particularly addresses the challenges of varying document quality and content types. Moving forward, focus should be on testing and optimizing the implementation while adding format-specific enhancements.

## Immediate Focus Areas
1. Testing the OCR pipeline with various document qualities
2. Implementing table structure preservation
3. Adding format-specific validation rules
4. Optimizing resource usage
5. Enhancing error reporting and recovery
