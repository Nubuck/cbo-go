# Document Processing Implementation Context - December 14, 2024

## Current Implementation State

Successfully implemented digital document processing pipeline with clean validation output. Currently investigating OCR document processing output discrepancies.

### Core Processing Flow
1. Document Entry
   - Determine if digital or OCR document
   - Extract digital content if available
   - Extract images for signature/mark verification

2. Content Extraction (unified text box model)
   - Process each page through appropriate pipeline
   - Normalize all text boxes to common format
   - Detect signatures regardless of source

3. Validation (single path)
   - Use HybridValidator for both digital and OCR content
   - Run post-validation analysis and enhancements
   - Generate standardized output

### Technical Improvements
- Removed Sharp dependency in favor of OpenCV WASM
- Enhanced image preprocessing pipeline
- Standardized text box model between digital and OCR paths

## Investigation Needed
Current OCR processing produces partial output compared to digital processing. Key areas to investigate:

1. Text Box Normalization
   - Verify OCR boxes match digital format
   - Check normalization of coordinates and bounds
   - Validate text content cleaning

2. OCR Processing Pipeline
   - Confirm complete page processing
   - Verify preprocessing effectiveness
   - Check enhancement triggers and results

3. Validation Quality
   - Compare text quality between paths
   - Verify field matching logic
   - Check confidence calculations

## Next Steps
1. Add logging at key transition points:
   - OCR text extraction
   - Box normalization
   - Field matching
   - Validation decisions

2. Compare outputs:
   - Digital vs OCR text quality
   - Box coordinate systems
   - Field confidence scores

3. Enhance OCR pipeline if needed:
   - Preprocessing adjustments
   - Text recognition improvements
   - Field detection refinement

## Dependencies
- OpenCV WASM for all image processing
- Tesseract WASM for OCR
- PDF.js for digital content extraction

## Processing Pipeline Performance
- Digital: Successfully validates documents
- OCR: Partial success, needs investigation
- Signatures: Working for both paths

This context will guide our next conversation focusing on OCR output investigation and alignment with digital processing results.
