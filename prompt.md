Amazing. Let's give it a try. I have added the new project-context.md document and latest repomix.xml file with the digital-application.pdf and scanned-application.pdf to project knowledge.
After running the simple-main.js test with the digital application I have added the following outputs to project knowledge:
- debug_merged_boxes.json (I left out debug_bounding_boxes.json cause it was too big from project knowledge)
- spatial_result.json
- spatial_validation_log.txt

Please review if this is enough information to investigate the issues and resolve them?
