It's been a long time since we worked on this project. I am returning to this project because it has become critical to make meaningful progress on the OCR aspect due to the fact the production project and other factors of my position have lead me to burn out and my health is a very serious condition, so we need to urgently get to a point where the CBO Confirm Verification Quality automation project can run without as much manual intervention in the event I have to take urgent leave for health reasons.

I need you ultrathink to review where we started and where we are now, reviewing the following historical documents from: docs/brief.md -> project-context.md -> project-status.md to SIGNATURE_INSTRUCTION.md

We have recently deployed another automation project called the Deceased Estate automation that verifies ID and court documents for deceased customers of the bank. We called it DEA.
The DEA project used the work we have done in this project as a launch pad from it's own features, and introduced a new OCR package called scribe.js-ocr and important features we will need in this project such as multi document in pages detection.

Please review the work in the DEA project derived from the work here for additional context of what is possible, I have included the DEA project files for reference here:
- dea/index.js
- dea/id-document-detector.js
- dea/package.json

I have also included the scribe.js-ocr docs in the project here:
- docs/scribe/README.md
- docs/scribe/API.md

When we last left off we were struggling to get the page areas of the extracted and scaled images from the document PDFs where client initials and signatures go for us to evaluated the texture of the area for signs of any markings, hand scribbles, stamps, inserted digital characters etc - anything to indicate an acknowledgment as an initial or signature - where a blank space would be invalid.

For this feature I think it best we extract the scaled PDF pages as images (pdf-to-img extracts images and scales them as we are doing in src/cli/spatial-document-validator.js on lines 2438 to 2444) into a folder called _extract with a subfolder for the document caseId from the caseModel in src/simple-main.js, for use to evaluate, then a json file with all the images extracted actual dimensions after being extracted and scaled with the area dimensions and co-ordinates of where we are going to look for signatures, as the initial box on the documents are in the bottom left corner of every page except the signature box that is on the last page in varying locations depending on the variant of contract.

You're life saving assistance here is most appreciated. Please advise on your latest evaluation of where we currently are, the advances in Claude Code abilities and knowledge of OCR and document processing since we last worked on this project and as always, any questions for clarity.

Business has scheduled a demo of the current CBO Quality verification automation process today and I'm struggling to think of way to demo a process that runs mostly in the background from the terminal - the only visible automation actions is when the bot opens the BPM web UI to approve a case or flag it for issues - I have a few ideas: ask you to help me generate a visually impressive diagram of the process - something richer than a normal mermaid process diagram - the other idea is to develop a quick prototype dashboard based off of a react dashboard project built for other automation projects that have all the elements required, we just need to add a PDF viewer with the ability to draw bounding boxes around fields which would be green when valid or red when invalid - do you have any ideas further?

lets start with an interactive or at least rich diagram - if we need to build out a web app or something for it Im happy since react has many great packages for diagrams and icons.
The CBO Confirm verification quality flow I will try best represent below:
- The process starts with the orchestrator agent that:
  - queries the IBM BPM API to retrieve loan cases in the CBO Quality Verification team queue (these loans are Personal Loans, New Credit Cards, Credit Card limit increases, New Overdrafts and Overdraft limit increases)
  - when there are cases in the CBO Quality Verification team queue the orchestrator agent will claim the cases under a commonly used non warm body domain account that all agents use and then assign the verification process of each case to 1 of the agents (bots) in the Roboteur RPA platform swarm (bot group) usually about 5 agensts / bots
  - then the orchestrator agent will collect the details of each case that were claimed and assigned from the IBM BPM API and save those details to the Roboteur RPA platform realtime database for the assigned bots to collect and process
  - for each bot in the Roboteur swarm they check their assigned cases after completion of a case, they will then:
    - retrieve the case data and then query the ECM document server for the case PAQ (Pre-Agreement Quote), Application Document and bank statement
    - then extract the PDF data as digital or perform advanced OCR to extract the document fields to validate
    - then compare the extracted PAQ and Application document field data to the IBM BPM data model to verify that the loan details are correct and eligible to disburse. 
    - the bot then checks the bank statements to ensure the debit order and disbursement accounts belong the client
    - for personal loan cases if the client decides to arrange their own insurance the bot will then query the ECM document server again for a 3rd party insurance document or waiver
    - if the documents collected are incomplete or missing the bot will assign the case to the 2nd queue agents to query the ECM document server further and setting a timeout to allow for delayed document linking or further image processing to enhance the OCR output
    - when all the validation checks pass the bot uses web automation to login to the IBM BPM web ui, search for and enter the case task and approve the case for disbursement with a comment of all the checks that passed
    - when there are issues with the case documents, either the extracted fields do not match BPM or are missing the bot uses web automation to login to the IBM BPM web ui, search for and enter the case task and flags the case to the liaison queue requesting corrected or updated documents
    - when edge cases are found they are assigned to the review queue for manual disbursement which are about 1% of cases per month
    - this process then repeats

  cbo-demo-dashboard/brand/index.css and incorporate the Nedbank logo in the header from the source file cbo-demo-dashboard/brand/Logo.tsx - also the system metrics and processing statitics of the dashboard are really not a focus for this presentation, please can we rather emphasize the current step of the simulated process currently in the side bar and increase the side bar width a little to eliminate the scrollbars

  Please review cbo-demo-dashboard/web.log I am getting errors that crash the demo when running the success simulation
